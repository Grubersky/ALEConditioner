Avid ALE Conditioner

    Usecase:
        Avid ALE Metadata Import only allows Characters in
        the ASCII Range. If you have Umlaute (äöü) or other
        Characters in your Script Metadata, you'll end up
        with all sorts of funny Characters.
        This little App for MacOS converts Umlaute and
        everything else and replaces it into their ASCII
        counterparts.
        If there are no fitting counterparts, the illegal
        Charakter will be removed.
